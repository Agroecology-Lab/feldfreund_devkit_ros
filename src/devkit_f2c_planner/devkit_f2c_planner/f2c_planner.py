f2c_planner.py
──────────────
Field2Cover planning core: lat/lon <-> local-XY projection and the swath
generator. Standalone package (devkit_f2c_planner) with no NiceGUI/UI
dependency, so any caller can use it.

Originally lived inside devkit_ui/ui_node.py, coupled to the manual-drawing
mission workflow. First pulled into devkit_ui/f2c_planner.py so the
terrain-aware pipeline (devkit_ui/terrain_mask.py) could share the same
projection — anchored at the same lat0/lon0 — without reaching into
ui_node's internals. Promoted to its own package because "planning core"
and "web UI" are different concerns with different reasons to change, and
nothing about this module actually depends on devkit_ui.

devkit_ui still owns the manual-drawing UI and calls _run_f2c() the same
way it always did, now via the devkit_f2c_planner dependency instead of a
same-package import.

# OBSTACLE: shapely post-clipping for swath/obstacle avoidance.
#
# We do not trust F2C's interior-ring handling. Across F2C builds and
# Python-binding versions the behaviour of SG_BruteForce with respect to
# Cell holes is inconsistent — sometimes swaths are clipped against
# holes, sometimes they aren't, with no error either way. Field tests
# showed swaths running straight through marked obstacles even with CW-
# wound interior rings.
#
# The fix: generate swaths against the outer boundary (F2C's job), then
# compute swath_line.difference(union_of_obstacle_polygons) ourselves
# (shapely's job). This is observable, deterministic, and guarantees the
# lines you see on the Mission map are the lines the robot will follow.
#
# Obstacle rings are still added to the F2C Cell as a hint — belt and
# braces — but the safety net is the shapely post-clip.
#
# HEADLAND: optional Minkowski erosion of the field by headland_width_m
# before swath generation, so swaths don't start/end exactly at the
# field boundary. Done via F2C's HG_Const_gen; wrapped in try/except
# because the headland call can fail on degenerate / very narrow fields.
#
# SNAKE: optional boustrophedon ordering — every second swath reversed
# so end-of-swath-N is near start-of-swath-N+1. Done in Python rather
# than via f2c.RP_Snake to avoid depending on which route-planner API
# the local F2C build exposes. Snake-flip happens *before* shapely
# clipping so direction is preserved per-fragment when an obstacle
# splits a swath into pieces.

# CONTOUR ROWS: curved swaths that follow the terrain instead of F2C's
# single fixed sweep angle.
#
# F2C's own swath generator (SG_BruteForce, used by _run_f2c() above) only
# produces straight parallel lines — its documented model assumes flat
# topography. That's not a config flag to change, it's the geometry core,
# so this doesn't patch F2C; it's a second, independent row generator that
# reuses _run_f2c()'s projection and obstacle-clipping helpers instead of
# F2C's swath math.
#
# Method: offset a single reference line (dem.select_reference_contour_*(),
# the elevation isoline through the field centroid — see that module for
# why the centroid) by +/- n*tool_width using shapely's offset_curve(),
# both directions, until the offset runs off the field. This gives exact,
# constant row spacing everywhere — the trade-off, discussed and accepted
# rather than avoided, is that only the reference row itself is a true
# elevation contour; rows further out are geometrically parallel to it but
# will drift from the *actual* isoline at that offset, in proportion to
# how much the terrain curves between the two. Centring the reference on
# the field means that drift is at most ~half the field's cross-slope
# width in either direction rather than the full width.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION, not yet handled: offset_curve() on a bendy reference
# line at a distance approaching the local radius of curvature can produce
